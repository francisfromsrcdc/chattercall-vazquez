ChatterCall is a Django-based web application that aims to produce an 
alternative to chatrooms and contacting other people. It features basic user 
authentication, and CRUD operations after the user has logged in. Although 
simple in design, it serves its main purpose well. ChatterCall also uses HTTP 
and CSS coding within its design.

## Features
1. User authentication with log in and registration features.
2. CRUD operations if you go to your profile page.
3. Admin CRUD operations if you go to the default django admin page.
4. Real-time chatrooms using django channels and websocket.

## Purpose
ChatterCallâ€™s main purpose is to serve as an alternative to chatroom, 
messaging, and social media sites. Chatroom sites often struggle with issues 
such as inappropriate behavior, and spam which can hurt user experience.
